# Create-Glowing-Bacteria-Hyperskill
This is "Create Glowing Bacteria" project form Hyperskill.<br>
Learn about bacterial genome organization and genetic engineering techniques, work on data sequencing, and see how Python can be applied to bioinformatics.<br>
Isn't it nice to have a luminous fish that would glow in the dark? Dreams about such pets have become a reality thanks to genetic engineering! In this project, we offer you to put on a robe of a scientist and create a luminous bacterium. You will learn the genome of these tiny creatures and some basic methods of genetic engineering.<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
